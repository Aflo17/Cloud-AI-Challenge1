# Cloud-AI-Challenge1

## Description

I was unable to find a good repository to help with the hybrid setup of using Azure for Analysis and OpenAI endpoint for the Generated images. I Hope my code and repository can help.

This project is a Blazor application that uses Azure's Vision service to analyze images and OpenAI's DALL-E model to generate images from text prompts. The user can enter an image URL or a text prompt, and then either generate an image from the text prompt or analyze the image at the provided URL.

## Setup

Where the code lies to make this function lies within Layout>Pages>Home.razor

OPENAI_KEY: The key for your OpenAI service.
VISION_ENDPOINT: The endpoint URL of your Azure Vision service.
VISION_KEY: The key for your Azure Vision service.

dotnet run (to run the application)
### Prerequisites

- .NET 5.0 or later
- An Azure account with an active subscription
- An OpenAI account with an active subscription (Will need a paid subscription in order to have the images generated.)
- 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aflo17/Cloud-AI-Challenge1.git

### This is my first README sorry if I'm missing anything.
